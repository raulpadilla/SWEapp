        <p>A <b>Frontal Strategy</b> is a direct approach based on the customers 
          perception of your overwhelming superiority in solution, price, or reputation.</p>
        <p>Guidelines for implementing a frontal strategy are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>A 3:1 advantage. </b>The customer must perceive that you are 
            three times better than your competition in product or service functions, 
            sales resources, price or other critical selection criteria.</li>
          <li><b>Strength, speed, or surprise. </b>Using a frontal strategy requires 
            overwhelming strength, ability to close the sale before the competition 
            can react, or being first on the scene (so you can set the agenda).</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Potential problems include:</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Resource requirements (#8). </b>Using this strategy requires 
            lots of time, money and personnel because you have to overwhelm the 
            competition.</li>
          <li><b>Obvious to competition. </b>The competition will see what you 
            are doing immediately, so you have to act quickly; otherwise the competition 
            might have an opportunity to outmaneuver you.</li>
          <li><b>Easiest to defeat. </b>Because of the cautions mentioned above, 
            the frontal strategy is the most easily defeated strategy. It is also 
            the most common strategy used by sellers.</li>
        </ul>
