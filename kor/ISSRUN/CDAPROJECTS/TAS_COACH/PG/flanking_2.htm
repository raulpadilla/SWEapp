        <p>A <b>Flanking Strategy</b> shifts the customer's buying criteria to 
          new, or different, issues that favor your solution. When using a flanking 
          strategy, you attempt to shift the criteria to your strengths and your 
          competitor's weaknesses.</p>
        <p>Guidelines for implementing a flanking strategy are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Not playing by the rules. </b>By definition, using a flanking 
            strategy means you are changing the ground rules.</li>
          <li><b>Right timing, right target, right issues. </b>If you present 
            your solution too soon, or too late, the customer may not be open 
            to hearing it, or see its relevance to their organization. You also 
            have to address your new selection criteria to the people who can 
            benefit from it. Make certain you have thoroughly examined all your 
            capabilities to find unique ways you could add value for the customer.<br>
          </li>
          <li><b>Adding business value (#10). </b>If you are shifting the selection 
            criteria, you have to shift it in a way that adds value for the customer.</li>
          <li><b>Getting inside support (#11).</b> Someone of reliable influence 
            in the customer organization will have to help you determine where 
            you can add value by changing the rules.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Potential problems include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>New competitors. </b>When you change the rules, traditional and 
            non-traditional external competitors, as well as internal solutions, 
            may become viable.</li>
          <li><b>Potential to fail if the strategy is implemented at an inappropriate 
            time. </b>Timing is everything when it comes to launching this strategy. 
            Make sure the competition&#146;s solutions do not become more compelling 
            than yours based on the new criteria you have established.</li>
