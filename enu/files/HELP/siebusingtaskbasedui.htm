<h2><a name="abouttaskbasedui"></a>About Task UI</h2>
<p>Task user interface (UI) is a wizard-like user interface that: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Guides you through task execution </li>
	<li>Allows you to navigate back and forward within task execution </li>
	<li>Allows you to resume or pause task execution at any point</li>
</ul>
<p>The Task UI includes the following features that support task execution: </p>
<table  cellpadding="5" width="667" id="table3" summary="This table describes Task UI features that support task execution.">
	<tr>
		<td>Task pane</td>
		<td width="554">The left side of the screen contains a context-sensitive 
		listing of the tasks available to you. These tasks relate to the 
		current context. When you select a given task, the Task Pane shows the 
		sequence of steps for that task. </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Play bar</td>
		<td width="554">The Task screen has a standard set of four buttons that 
		control the navigation in the task flow. It includes buttons to move 
		forward and back through the steps and provides the ability to pause a 
		task for later resumption, or cancel a task.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Radio buttons</td>
		<td width="554">Radio buttons provide support for decision-making within 
		a task. Based on the choices within a task, you can access different 
		branches and different screens.</td>
	</tr>

<h2><a name="navigationalbuttonsfortaskbasedui"></a>Navigational Buttons for the Task UI</h2>
<p>Many of the buttons described in the following table might appear at the 
bottom of the Task UI wizard. In addition to these buttons, your Siebel 
application might contain additional buttons.</p>
<table  cellpadding="5" width="667" id="table2" summary="This table describes navigational buttons for the Task UI. ">
	<tr>
		<td>Previous</td>
		<td width="554"><font SIZE="1">The Previous button navigates to the 
		previous step in the task. This button is disabled for the first step. 
		It might also be disabled for the steps that follow the step when data has been committed to the database.</font></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>&nbsp;Next</td>
		<td width="554"><font SIZE="1">The Next button navigates to the next 
		step in the task. This button also acts as a validation point and 
		prevents you from proceeding to the next step until the required 
		criteria are met. It is&nbsp; relabeled <i>Finish</i> when you reach 
		the final step of the task. </font> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Pause</td>
		<td width="554"><font SIZE="1">The Pause button saves the task in its 
		current stage and sends the task to your Inbox. You can launch the task 
		later and resume from where you left off. You can set this option from 
		User Preferences as follows:<p>From the application-level menu, choose 
		Tools, then User Preferences. The User Preferences screen appears. <br>
		On the link bar, click Behavior. The Behavior form appears. <br>
		Select the check box labeled, Prompt to Pause When a User Interrupts a 
		Task button. 
		</font> </td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Cancel</td>
		<td width="554"><font size="1">Cancel deletes the task without saving any data or in 
		the case of a task that has been previously saved, restores it to its 
		previous state. The Pause and Cancel buttons are enabled for all steps. 
		However, the Cancel button is disabled on the last step after data is 
		committed.</font></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Submit</td>
		<td width="554"><font SIZE="1">The Submit button indicates that data 
		is written to the database while in the middle of a task. This action 
		means that some data is written to the database rather than queued until the end of 
		the task.</font></td>
	</tr>
