	<p><!---font size="2" face="arial, helvetica">The insider trading window set forth in Siebel Systems Policy #106 (Stock Trading by Directors, Officers and Other Members of Management) is now open, and is scheduled to remain open until the close of trading on June 2, 2000. The Company may close the window sooner, however, if any material non-public information comes into existence that would make it inappropriate for you to continue trading in the Company's common stock.
<p>The trading window is expected to re-open three business days after the Company reports its quarterly earnings.  At this time, the exact date of that earnings release is not available.  The Company will notify you when the trading window officially re-opens.  Please note, however, that the Company may elect in its sole discretion to keep the trading window closed beyond any scheduled opening date.
