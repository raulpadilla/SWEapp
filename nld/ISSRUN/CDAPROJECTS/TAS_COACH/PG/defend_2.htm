        <p>A <b>Defend Strategy</b> protects your position from inevitable assault 
          by competitors. When using a defend strategy, you attempt to protect 
          your position with the customer.</p>
        <p class="soltutiontitle">Guidelines for implementing a defend strategy are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Extend your relationship (#12). </b>Use your presence in the 
            account to build relationships at the executive level, thus ensuring 
            that you are the first to hear about new business initiatives and 
            opportunities.</li>
          <li><b>Support your allies. </b>Your allies at every level can help 
            you fend off competitive intrusions. Make sure you support them when 
            they need it, so they will support you when the time comes.</li>
          <li><b>Articulate your credibility (#12) and business value (#10). </b>Consider 
            having a review with the key players in the account. Use the sessions 
            to reinforce your credibility, and get credit for the value your solutions 
            brings to the organization.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="soltutiontitle">Potential problems include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Self-Isolation. </b>There is a tendency to relax after you have 
            closed an opportunity. Don't allow yourself to get too comfortable 
            and stop expanding your relationship..</li>
          <li><b>Complacency. </b>Be careful not to let that victory blind you 
            to your competitors' attacks, which will come.</li>
        </ul>
