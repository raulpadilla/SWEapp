        <p>A <b>Fragment Strategy</b> divides the opportunity into smaller pieces, 
          and focuses the customer on a subset of the issues that you can address. 
          When using a fragment strategy, you attempt to focus on the portion 
          of the opportunity you think you can win.</p>
        <p>Guidelines for implementing a fragment strategy are:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Developing leverage for the future. </b>The idea is to achieve 
            a foothold or presence that you can expand later. So, make sure to 
            choose a base from which you can expand for future revenue (#17).</li>
          <li><b>Obtaining insider support. </b>To attain leverage in an organization, 
            you need support from the people who want you to win.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Potential problems include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Expending resources on a limited opportunity. </b>Be sure you 
            are using your resources wisely, since the fragment you choose will 
            not be as profitable as the whole opportunity. Monitor the cost of 
            sales (#18) to be sure your investment is in line with the potential 
            long-term rewards.</li>
          <li><b>Opening the playing field to additional competitors. </b>When 
            you pursue one specific piece of the opportunity, other competitors 
            may imitate your strategy.</li>
